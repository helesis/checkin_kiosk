# checkin_kiosk

After corona virus recovery, hotels are going to integrate lots of new technologies like booking engines, mobile apps, digital concierge services, chatbots, automated checkins and checkout and finaly keyless entry systems.

Hoteliers plan to reduce the risk of virus transmisson with keyless entry systems. However, keyless entry will require an investment in money, time and commitment. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is the most commonly technology used in the hotel door locks. Hotels with this technology will need to replace this RFID locks with digital locks capable of communicating with a smartphone. Also a component to current property management system or a third-party software will be needed to assign rooms and issue key information, which brings additional investment.

Checkin kiosk is an alternative and cost effective solution. 

Current RFID locks remain. 
Check in and room selection is completed over mobile application.
After mobile check in guests get their room key from a kiosk located on different locations in the hotel.
Disinfected key cards are loaded to kiosks and bluetooth connection activates card vending.
Card tags are written by kiosk depending on the information coming from PMS.
